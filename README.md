This is my Coursera (IBM) Python Project for Data Science peer-graded assignment, and for it, I analysed historical stock and revenue data and built a dashboard. As a data scientist for an investment firm, I gathered the revenue data for Tesla and GameStop and made a dashboard to compare the stock price to the revenue. Before this assignment I completed the two previous yfinance and web scraping labs and In the final assignment I uploaded screenshots of the code and results and people also reviwed my assignment too.
